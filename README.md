# Reverb - Audio Reverb Effects

**Author:** Bocaletto Luca

**Language:** Python

## Description
"Reverb" is a Python application developed by Luca Bocaletto that allows you to create the audio reverb effect. This application provides users with the ability to add reverb to audio recordings, creating a spatial and reflective sound that simulates the echo of a sound within a physical space.

## Key Features
- **Parameter Adjustment:** Users can adjust the following parameters of the reverb effect:
  - Reverb Gain: The level of reverb signal increase relative to the original audio.
  - Reverb Length: The duration of the reverb, measured in milliseconds, influencing how long the sound continues to reflect.
  - Cutoff Frequency: The reverb's cutoff frequency, controlling the distribution of frequencies in the reverberated sound.
  - Decay Factor: The reverb decay rate, determining how quickly the echo fades over time.
- **Activation/Deactivation:** The application allows users to toggle the reverb effect on or off with a simple button.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** The user interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, featuring sliders for each parameter and a clear display of current values.
- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** The application processes audio in real-time, enabling users to immediately listen to the applied reverb effect.

## Usage
1. Adjust the reverb effect parameters using the corresponding sliders to achieve the desired sound.
2. Press the "Activate/Deactivate Reverb" button to enable or disable the reverb effect.
3. Listen to the audio with the reverb effect applied in real-time.

"Reverb" is a valuable tool for musicians, music producers, and audio enthusiasts looking to add a touch of spatiality and depth to their audio recordings.

**Note:** Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries listed in the code to run the application properly.
